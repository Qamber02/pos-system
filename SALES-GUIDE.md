[If no] When would be a good time to catch them?
[If yes] Great! I won't take much of your time.

I'm calling local businesses to introduce our POS system that actually works offline.

Many businesses like [nearby competitor] have switched because:
1. It never goes down
2. Tracks inventory automatically
3. Manages customer credits

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute demo this week? I can come to your location.

Compare that to [competitor] at $69/month - that's $828 per year.

You save $thousands over time.

[Pause for reaction]

What concerns do you have?"

Common Objections:

Objection: "It's expensive"
Answer: "I understand. But let's do quick math:

- This saves 3 hours/week = $150/month saved
- Pays for itself in 4 months"

Objection: "I need to think about it"
Answer: "Absolutely. Why don't you try it free for 14 days?
I'll install it today, train your staff, and if you don't love it, no charge."

Objection: "I'm happy with current system"
Answer: "That's great! Out of curiosity, does it handle [pain point they mentioned]?
What would make you consider switching?"

Objection: "I need to ask my partner"
Answer: "Makes sense! When will you two be together? I can come back and show both of you."
```

**Minutes 14-15: Close**

Option 1: Start your 14-day free trial today
- I'll install it now (20 minutes)
- Train you and your staff
- You test it for 2 weeks
- Only pay if you love it

Option 2: I can come back next week
